### Per Lundholm

*The harder the problems, the louder they call.*

You always need a truly senior developer like me in a team. Being senior not only means to write stable and maintainable code but also, have an eye on how the team works. Is it a team or just a group of individuals? Therefore, apart from 40+ years of programming, I also have acquired skills such as facilitation and agile principles.

But let us not stop there, a team must also understand the "why" behind their work. With me in the team, product management have a speaking partner that understands their context.

You can hire me! I work at Agical (Stockholm)  https://agical.se.
